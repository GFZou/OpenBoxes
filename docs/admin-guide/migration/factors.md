* Server Accessibility: The ability to provision resources on the hosting provider may not be available
* Cost: May incur additional costs that are prohibitive (even for a short period of time).
* Downtime Tolerance: If downtime is a significant concern, a parallel migration might be safer.
* Testing and Rollback: A new server deployment allows for better testing and easier rollback options.
* Resource Availability: In-place upgrades require fewer resources but can be riskier in terms of service disruption.
* Complexity of Dependencies: If the dependencies are numerous or complex, creating a new server might simplify the upgrade process.
