Describe the two migration approaches 

* Clean Slate Migration
* In-Place Migration

Both migration approaches require a heavy serving of precaution regarding the database backup.

Include a link for every migration we know about, including configuration changes, API changes, breaking changes.

* 0.8.x -> 0.9.x 
* 0.7.x -> 0.8.x (probably not necessary but we could )
