/**
 * Base class for all of our API/component tests.
 *
 * Note that even though we use the @Integration annotation, these tests are more like API tests because we're making
 * restful API calls into our server (hence the name ApiSpec). Confusingly, Grails refers to this type of API testing
 * as "functional testing", but we're going to ignore that term for our purposes because Grails "functional tests"
 * expect us to extend from GebSpec, which isn't supported for APIs that return JSON. Instead we use RestAssured.
 *
 * To be able to make Domain.save() calls from within a method, you must add the @Transactional annotation to it or
 * wrap the save with Domain.withNewTransaction{}. Remember that the transaction will only be submitted once the method
 * completes, and so don't annotate individual tests because then that data won't ever be visible. This is why
 * we didn't put the annotation at the class level. Use the setupData() method for creating domain data when possible.
 *
 * Note that we cannot use the @Rollback annotation here to automatically clean up data created by Domain.save() calls
 * because test HTTP clients and the server run in two separate processes and thus two separate transactions. If we
 * used the annotation, the Domain.save() data would get rolled back successfully, but would be totally inaccessible
 * by the server during the tests.
 *
 * As such, it's important to note that tests do *not* automatically cleanup their data. While we should try to add a
 * clean up step to our test suites, it's not enforceable that this actually happens, and so tests should always assume
 * the database is in a dirty state before running.
